"Solidity — A new and simple programming language that is popular amongst Ethereum developers, as it is the language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. Solidity is a contract-oriented Turing-complete programming language and the number of developers is estimated at over 200,000.

As Ethereum has taken the head start on smart contracts, many alternative blockchain platforms are ensuring that they are Solidity (or ERC-20) compatible, thus allowing smart contracts to be easily ported from Ethereum into their new blockchain networks.

Ethereum — Technically Ethereum functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a “world computer”, and is made up of multiple languages including C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and Java."

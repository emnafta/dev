What do we want to learn? For what kind of development? What is a must / good starting point.

## How to use Github:

Getting acquainted with GitHub should be a priority. Github provides resources for learning, such as:

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [GitHub Video Guides](youtube.com/githubguides) &
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

GitHub guides include the [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [What is Markdown?](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), among others.

## Learning Development- Resources

The following three sites provide free resources for learning different types of computer science and languages:

Eloquent Javascript [Link](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

Moralis [Link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWS9Q3P5AxCWyQLT2kQhBw)

MDN Development Resources [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Devdocs Development Resources [Link](https://devdocs.io/)

w3schools Development Resources [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/)

Freecodecamp Development Resources [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

**CryptoZombies!** [Link](https://cryptozombies.io/) - For intro to Solidity, prior knowledge recommended. (See Solidity.md)

Ivan on Tech Academy [Link](https://academy.ivanontech.com) - Membership required! 

## Blockchain Development Learning

A review of the literature shows that the following protocols are most often used by blockchain developers:

- Solidity- Developed by Ethereum, made up oof multiple language including C++, Python, Ruby, Go and Java
- C++
- Python
- Ruby- See: Izel Nakri, ["Ruby on Rails Tutorial"](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning?fbclid=IwAR2GdRymBULgPeJYnRPKFyZT4eFcjJdHFUYpjzsFy-77J7G8Q6cGJOarxWs#cha-beginning)
- Java
- Javascript - Learn node.js for webscraping
- Vyper (blockchain programming languuage)
- Golang
- C#
- Simplicity- high-level Blockchain development language that was created for smart contracts)
- Rholang
- Kubernetes (k8s)- See: Izel Nakri
- Rust- See: Izel Nakri
- Elixir- See: Izel Nakri
- (?) libp2p
- (?) Parity Tech (Substrate, Polkadot)
- (?) Clojure 
- (?) Erlang- Read: [Elixir vs. Erlang (Jun, 2020)](https://medium.com/@devathon_/elixir-vs-erlang-2020-de0facb6cd92)

"Solidity — A new and simple programming language that is popular amongst Ethereum developers, as it is the language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. Solidity is a contract-oriented Turing-complete programming language and the number of developers is estimated at over 200,000.

As Ethereum has taken the head start on smart contracts, many alternative blockchain platforms are ensuring that they are Solidity (or ERC-20) compatible, thus allowing smart contracts to be easily ported from Ethereum into their new blockchain networks.

Ethereum — Technically Ethereum functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a “world computer”, and is made up of multiple languages including C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and Java."

## Projects 

## Python Development via Minecraft

Python is the programming language we are currently focused on learning. We have started learning with [Minecraft](https://emnafta.github.io/minecraft-python/), to make the learning experience more enjoyable, relatable and applicable.

## Solidity Development via CryptoZombies

## Unblockchains.org Web Scraping Project

A project to aggregate news and reports on all things blockchain. Required learning: Ruby on rails, node.js/Javascript for webscraping

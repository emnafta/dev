## How to use Github:

Getting acquainted with GitHub should be a priority. Github provides resources for learning, such as:

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [GitHub Video Guides](youtube.com/githubguides) &
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

GitHub guides include the [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [What is Markdown?](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), among others.

## Learning Development- Resources

The following three sites provide free resources for learning different types of computer science and languages:

MDN Development Resources [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Devdocs Development Resources [Link](https://devdocs.io/)

w3schoools Development Resources [Link](https://https://www.w3schools.com/)

Freecodecamp Development Resources [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Blockchain Development Learning

A review of the literature shows that the following languages are most often used by Ethereum developers:
- Solidity
- C++
- Python
- Ruby
- Go
- Java
- Javascript

## Sources: 

[Freecodecamp, Most popular languages used in blockchain (2019)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-most-popular-programming-languages-used-in-blockchain-development-5133a0a207dc/)

"Solidity — A new and simple programming language that is popular amongst Ethereum developers, as it is the language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. Solidity is a contract-oriented Turing-complete programming language and the number of developers is estimated at over 200,000.

As Ethereum has taken the head start on smart contracts, many alternative blockchain platforms are ensuring that they are Solidity (or ERC-20) compatible, thus allowing smart contracts to be easily ported from Ethereum into their new blockchain networks.

Ethereum — Technically Ethereum functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a “world computer”, and is made up of multiple languages including C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and Java."

## Python Development via Minecraft

Python is the programming language we are currently focused on learning. We have started learning with [Minecraft](https://emnafta.github.io/minecraft-python/), to make the learning experience more enjoyable, relatable and applicable.
